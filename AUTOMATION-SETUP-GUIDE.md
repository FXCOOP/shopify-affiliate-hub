## Troubleshooting

### "I'm not getting traffic!"

**After 2 weeks:**
- Normal. SEO takes 2-3 months
- Focus on social platforms first
- Check: Are you posting consistently?

**After 1 month:**
- Review analytics: Which platforms sent traffic?
- Double down on what works
- Ensure links are working
- Check: Are you providing value or just posting links?

**After 2 months:**
- If still low traffic, audit:
  - Is content valuable? Ask for feedback
  - Are you posting enough? (2-3 hours/day minimum)
  - Are you using ChatGPT prompts correctly?
  - Are you engaging, not just posting?

### "Reddit removes my posts"

**Reasons:**
1. Too new account - Build karma first (2 weeks)
2. Too many links - Post more value, fewer links
3. Spam filter - Vary your comments, don't use templates
4. Breaking rules - Read subreddit rules carefully

**Solutions:**
- Build karma to 100+ before posting links
- Use different link formats
- Post from different devices/IPs if possible
- Don't post same link twice in same subreddit
- Wait 3-7 days between promotional posts

---

### "No one engages with my content"

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Is headline compelling? (Use numbers, curiosity)
- [ ] Is content valuable? (Would you upvote/share it?)
- [ ] Are you posting at right times?
- [ ] Are you engaging with others first?
- [ ] Are you in right communities?

**Quick fixes:**
- Study top posts in each platform
- Copy their structure (not content!)
- A/B test different headlines
- Ask questions to encourage comments
- Reply to every comment quickly

---

### "ChatGPT content sounds robotic"

**Solutions:**
1. Always edit ChatGPT output
2. Add personal anecdotes
3. Use conversational language
4. Break up long paragraphs
5. Add personality/humor
6. Remove obviously AI phrases like "delve", "in conclusion"

**Better prompt:**
```
"Write this in a casual, conversational tone as if you're texting a friend.
Use short sentences. No corporate buzzwords. Sound like a real person."
```

---

### "Too time-consuming!"

**If spending 5+ hours/day:**

**Optimize:**
1. Batch create content on Sundays (all week's content in 2-3 hours)
2. Schedule everything in Buffer/Tailwind
3. Set timers: 30 min per task max
4. Focus on top 3 platforms only
5. Use ChatGPT for everything

**Minimal viable routine (1.5 hours/day):**
- 30 min: Reddit (answer questions)
- 30 min: Twitter (1 thread + engagement)
- 30 min: Quora (1 detailed answer)
- Pinterest/LinkedIn: Automated with Buffer
